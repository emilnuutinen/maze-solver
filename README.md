# Maze-task

Pentti got stuck in a maze.

Implement an algorithm to find a route through a maze given in a .txt file, or tell if there is no possible route available.

In the map file ‘#’ represents a block, ‘ ‘ (space) represents movable space and ‘E’ means an exit. ‘^’ is the starting position. Going outside the maze area is not allowed.

Pentti can move in 4 directions, and each move has equal cost. Each map should be tried with the same algorithm and with 20, 150 and 200 maximum moves.
The solution must be printed to something visible, either to a file, on the command line, or graphically. Optimal solution not required, but bonus points for it!
